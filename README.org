Node.Town is not a software project but a software quest.  Its goals
are uncertain, its methods are unproven, and its outcomes are unknown.

We can describe its current manifestation, and chronicle its winding
path, but we cannot predict its future, for it is a living thing, an
impulse, a spirit, a daydream.
