* Coherent Deployment

The Node.Town domain needs a stable referent.

** Resources, Context, and the Referent

What are my dramatic resources, so to speak?

In terms of skills and technologies, here's a base set:

  1. NixOS
  2. Git
  3. Prolog

OK, we can characterize the Node.Town production system as follows.

  1. NixOS is the operating system.
  2. Git is the version control system.
  3. Prolog is the programming language.
